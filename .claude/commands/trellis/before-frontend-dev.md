Read the frontend development guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/frontend/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - Component work → `.trellis/spec/frontend/component-guidelines.md`
   - Hook work → `.trellis/spec/frontend/hook-guidelines.md`
   - State management → `.trellis/spec/frontend/state-management.md`
   - Type questions → `.trellis/spec/frontend/type-safety.md`
3. Understand the coding standards and patterns you need to follow
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before writing any frontend code.
