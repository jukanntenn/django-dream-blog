Read the backend development guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/backend/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - Database work → `.trellis/spec/backend/database-guidelines.md`
   - Error handling → `.trellis/spec/backend/error-handling.md`
   - Logging → `.trellis/spec/backend/logging-guidelines.md`
   - Type questions → `.trellis/spec/backend/type-safety.md`
3. Understand the coding standards and patterns you need to follow
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before writing any backend code.
