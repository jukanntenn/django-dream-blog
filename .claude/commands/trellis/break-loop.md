# Break the Loop - Deep Bug Analysis

When debug is complete, use this command for deep analysis to break the "fix bug -> forget -> repeat" cycle.

---

## Analysis Framework

Analyze the bug you just fixed from these 5 dimensions:

### 1. Root Cause Category

Which category does this bug belong to?

| Category | Characteristics | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **A. Missing Spec** | No documentation on how to do it | New feature without checklist |
| **B. Cross-Layer Contract** | Interface between layers unclear | API returns different format than expected |
| **C. Change Propagation Failure** | Changed one place, missed others | Changed function signature, missed call sites |
| **D. Test Coverage Gap** | Unit test passes, integration fails | Works alone, breaks when combined |
| **E. Implicit Assumption** | Code relies on undocumented assumption | Timestamp seconds vs milliseconds |

### 2. Why Fixes Failed (if applicable)

If you tried multiple fixes before succeeding, analyze each failure:

- **Surface Fix**: Fixed symptom, not root cause
- **Incomplete Scope**: Found root cause, didn't cover all cases
- **Tool Limitation**: grep missed it, type check wasn't strict
- **Mental Model**: Kept looking in same layer, didn't think cross-layer

### 3. Prevention Mechanisms

What mechanisms would prevent this from happening again?

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Documentation** | Write it down so people know | Update thinking guide |
| **Architecture** | Make the error impossible structurally | Type-safe wrappers |
| **Compile-time** | TypeScript strict, no any | Signature change causes compile error |
| **Runtime** | Monitoring, alerts, scans | Detect orphan entities |
| **Test Coverage** | E2E tests, integration tests | Verify full flow |
| **Code Review** | Checklist, PR template | "Did you check X?" |

### 4. Systematic Expansion

What broader problems does this bug reveal?

- **Similar Issues**: Where else might this problem exist?
- **Design Flaw**: Is there a fundamental architecture issue?
- **Process Flaw**: Is there a development process improvement?
- **Knowledge Gap**: Is the team missing some understanding?

### 5. Knowledge Capture

Solidify insights into the system:

- [ ] Update `.trellis/spec/guides/` thinking guides
- [ ] Update `.trellis/spec/backend/` or `frontend/` docs
- [ ] Create issue record (if applicable)
- [ ] Create feature ticket for root fix
- [ ] Update check commands if needed

## Core Philosophy

> **The value of debugging is not in fixing the bug, but in making this class of bugs never happen again.**

Three levels of insight:
1. **Tactical**: How to fix THIS bug
2. **Strategic**: How to prevent THIS CLASS of bugs
3. **Philosophical**: How to expand thinking patterns

30 minutes of analysis saves 30 hours of future debugging.

## After Analysis: Immediate Actions

**IMPORTANT**: After completing the analysis above, you MUST immediately:

1. **Update spec/guides** - Don't just list TODOs, actually update the relevant files:
   - If it's a cross-platform issue → update `cross-platform-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's a cross-layer issue → update `cross-layer-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's a code reuse issue → update `code-reuse-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's domain-specific → update `backend/*.md` or `frontend/*.md`

2. **Sync templates** - After updating `.trellis/spec/`, sync to `src/templates/markdown/spec/`

3. **Commit the spec updates** - This is the primary output, not just the analysis text

> **The analysis is worthless if it stays in chat. The value is in the updated specs.**
